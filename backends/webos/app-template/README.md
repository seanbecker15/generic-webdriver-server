# WebOS Container Application Template

This is a template for a hosted web app for WebOS.

It contains a scaffolded WebOS project files with html and javascript, and has only one primary component,
which is an index.html file pointing to some specific destination.  The application is
almost entirely hosted web app boilerplate from the ares cli.

The index.html file will be overwritten with a specific URL before being
built and deployed to the WebOS device.
